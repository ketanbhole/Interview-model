  "transcript": "INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (Duration: 45 mins)\n\nInterviewer: Hi Maria. Let's start with a scenario. We have a data center in Frankfurt and one in Tokyo. Suddenly, latency spikes from 200ms to 400ms. Bandwidth usage is normal. No link alarms. What do you do?\n\nCandidate: First, I'd verify the physical path. I'd run a `traceroute` from a host in Frankfurt to Tokyo. I want to see if the path has changed. If the latency jumped that much, we might have lost a direct sub-sea cable route and traffic is re-routing via the US or somewhere longer.\n\nInterviewer: The traceroute shows traffic is now going Frankfurt -> New York -> LA -> Tokyo. It used to go Frankfurt -> Dubai -> Mumbai -> Singapore -> Tokyo. Why would BGP shift the traffic?\n\nCandidate: BGP prefers the shortest AS Path by default. It's possible a link between Mumbai and Singapore went down, withdrawing that route. Or, maybe a transit provider in the US accidentally advertised a more specific prefix (a route leak), sucking in our traffic. I would check the \"Looking Glass\" of our upstream providers to see how they are viewing our prefixes.\n\nInterviewer: Good. It turns out it wasn't a route leak. It was a flapping link in Mumbai causing BGP to recalculate constantly. How do you stabilize that?\n\nCandidate: We should implement \"Route Dampening\". If a route flaps (goes up/down) more than X times in Y minutes, the router suppresses it for a penalty period. This prevents the instability from propagating across the global table. Also, on the specific interface, we should check for CRC errors to see if it's a dirty fiber connector.\n\nInterviewer: Let's talk about the Data Center Fabric. We use a Leaf-Spine topology with ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path). A developer complains that *some* of their SSH connections to a server are timing out, but others work fine. Pings are 100% successful. What's happening?\n\nCandidate: That sounds like a hashing polarization issue or a bad link in the ECMP bundle. Ping uses ICMP, which might hash to \"Link A\". SSH uses TCP, which has a different source port, so it might hash to \"Link B\". If Link B is \"blackholing\" traffic (passing packets but dropping some due to MTU or hardware faults), you get this intermittent behavior.\n\nInterviewer: Exactly. How do you find the bad link?\n\nCandidate: I'd use `traceroute` with the `-p` option to vary the destination port, forcing it to exercise different ECMP paths. Or better yet, I'd check the interface counters on all the Spine switches. If one interface has high \"Output Drops\" or \"Input Errors\", that's likely the culprit.\n\nInterviewer: Nice. Last question on automation. We have 500 routers. I need to update the NTP server config on all of them. How do you do it?\n\nCandidate: I wouldn't SSH into them one by one. I'd write a Python script using the Nornir framework or Ansible. I'd create a Jinja2 template with the new NTP config. The script would iterate through the inventory, connect, diff the config to ensure safety, push the change, and then validate that the NTP stratum is synchronized afterwards."
