  "transcript": "INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (Duration: 40 mins)\n\nInterviewer: Hi Barbara. Coming from a bank to a tech startup is a big change. Why the switch?\n\nCandidate: I want to bring some order to the chaos. I hear startups are messy. I'm good at writing policies and making sure people follow the rules.\n\nInterviewer: Interesting. Let's tackle a scenario. A high-performing Senior Engineer, Dave, has started coming in at 11 AM and leaving at 7 PM. He's delivering all his code, but his manager is annoyed because the daily standup is at 10 AM. Dave says he works better late at night. What do you do?\n\nCandidate: Well, the policy is 9-to-5, right? If the standup is at 10, he is late. That is time theft. I would issue a verbal warning immediately. If he does it again, I'd move to a written warning. We can't have people making their own schedules. It sets a bad precedent.\n\nInterviewer: But he is our top performer. If we write him up, he might quit. Is there a middle ground?\n\nCandidate: If he quits, he wasn't a team player. Rules are rules. If you let the \"stars\" break the rules, you open the company up to discrimination lawsuits from the other employees who *do* show up on time. Compliance has to be black and white.\n\nInterviewer: I see. How do you handle \"Performance Improvement Plans\" (PIPs)?\n\nCandidate: A PIP is essentially the first step of termination. I make sure the manager documents every single mistake for 30 days. We need a paper trail so they can't sue us for wrongful termination. It's about protecting the company assets.\n\nInterviewer: Do you ever see a PIP as a tool to actually help the employee improve?\n\nCandidate: In my 15 years, I've never seen anyone survive a PIP. It's usually better to just cut them loose and save the paperwork, but legal requires the process.\n\nInterviewer: Okay. We do quarterly engagement surveys. If the \"Manager Effectiveness\" score drops in the Engineering team, how would you investigate?\n\nCandidate: I would look at who complained. Are they the low performers? Usually, people complain when they are being held accountable. I'd audit the time-sheets of the complainers to see if they are actually working."
