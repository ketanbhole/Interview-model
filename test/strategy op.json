  "transcript": "INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (Duration: 40 mins)\n\nInterviewer: Hi James. We are a messy Series B startup, not a Fortune 500. Our Engineering and Sales teams are at war. Engineering says Sales overpromises; Sales says Engineering is too slow. As Head of Strategy, how do you fix this?\n\nCandidate: This is a classic \"Misaligned Incentives\" problem. I would initiate a stakeholder interview process. I'd spend 2 weeks interviewing the VP of Sales and VP of Engineering to create a \"Current State Assessment\" deck. Then, I would propose a \"Synergy Framework\" to align their OKRs.\n\nInterviewer: Okay, frameworks are nice. But practically, what do you change on Monday morning?\n\nCandidate: I would set up a \"Steering Committee\". We would meet bi-weekly to discuss the roadmap. I would act as the facilitator to ensure synergy.\n\nInterviewer: We already have meetings. They just yell at each other. How do you actually get them to agree on a feature release date?\n\nCandidate: Well, it's about culture change. We need a \"North Star\" metric that they both share. I would run a workshop to define our corporate values.\n\nInterviewer: (Frustrated) Let's try a different angle. We want to expand to Europe. How do you decide which country to launch first?\n\nCandidate: I would build a market sizing model. Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM). We would look at GDP per capita and competitor density. I'd create a weighted matrix in Excel.\n\nInterviewer: Great. Suppose the matrix says \"Germany\". But we don't have a German speaker on the support team, and our payment processor doesn't support SEPA direct debit yet. Do we still launch?\n\nCandidate: The strategic data points to Germany. Those operational details are execution problems. The Operations team should figure out the payments. My job is to identify the market opportunity.\n\nInterviewer: In a startup, Strategy *is* Execution. If we can't take payments, the TAM doesn't matter. Have you ever actually set up a payment processor or hired a support team?\n\nCandidate: No, as a consultant, I focus on the high-level strategy and hand off the implementation to the client teams."
