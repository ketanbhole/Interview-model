  "transcript": "INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (Duration: 35 mins)\n\nInterviewer: Marcus, your traffic growth numbers are impressive. How did you identify the topics that drove that growth?\n\nCandidate: I didn't just chase high-volume keywords. I looked for \"High Intent, Low Difficulty\" gaps. For example, everyone was writing about \"Productivity Tips\" (Volume: 100k, Difficulty: Hard). I found keywords like \"best productivity tools for remote marketing teams\" (Volume: 500, Difficulty: Easy).\nWe wrote \"Hub & Spoke\" content. I created one massive \"Ultimate Guide to Remote Work\" (The Hub) and then wrote 10 smaller articles linking back to it (The Spokes). This signal tells Google we are the authority on that topic cluster.\n\nInterviewer: That's classic SEO strategy. Good. But how do you write for *humans*, not just Google bots? Our product is technical.\n\nCandidate: That's crucial. I don't just Google the topic and rewrite what's on the first page (Skyscraper technique). That creates generic fluff.\nI interview the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). If I'm writing about \"API Rate Limiting\", I sit down with your Lead Engineer for 30 minutes. I record the call. I use *their* metaphors and *their* war stories. That adds a layer of depth that a generic freelance writer can't fake. Google's new \"Helpful Content Update\" actually rewards this kind of expert-verified content now.\n\nInterviewer: Suppose we publish a great post, but nobody reads it. How do you handle distribution?\n\nCandidate: \"Create once, distribute forever.\" I don't just hit publish and pray.\n1. I turn the main points into a Twitter thread.\n2. I make a carousel for LinkedIn.\n3. I extract the best quote for a newsletter blurb.\n4. I answer relevant Quora/Reddit questions with a snippet and a link.\nIf we spend 10 hours writing, we should spend 10 hours distributing.\n\nInterviewer: We want to capture leads. Where do you put the Call to Action (CTA)?\n\nCandidate: Don't put a generic \"Sign Up\" button at the bottom. Nobody clicks that. I use \"Contextual CTAs\". If the paragraph talks about how hard it is to schedule meetings, I insert a text link right there: \"See how our tool automates scheduling in 1 click.\" It feels helpful, not salesy."
