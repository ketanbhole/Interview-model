  "transcript": "INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (Duration: 50 mins)\n\nInterviewer: Hi David. Let's start with a nightmare scenario. Your primary factory in Shenzhen goes into lockdown due to a health policy 3 weeks before Black Friday. You have 5,000 units stuck on the factory floor. What do you do?\n\nCandidate: This actually happened to me in 2021. First, immediate communication. I'd call our freight forwarder to see if *any* trucks are allowed in. If not, I look at our \"Safety Stock\" in the US 3PL.\nIf we are going to stock out, I prioritize channels. I'd cut ad spend immediately to slow demand. I'd prioritize direct website orders (higher margin) over Amazon (lower margin).\nThen, I'd look for \"WIP\" (Work In Progress) inventory at our secondary assembly plant in Vietnam. It costs 30% more to air freight from Vietnam, but losing Q4 revenue is worse. I'd pay the premium to air freight 2,000 units just to keep the lights on.\n\nInterviewer: That's a solid triage plan. You mentioned cutting Amazon. Why?\n\nCandidate: Amazon penalizes you heavily for stockouts. If your \"In-Stock Rate\" drops, you lose the Buy Box and your organic ranking tanks. It takes months to recover. It's actually better to mark the item as \"Temporarily Unavailable\" or raise the price significantly to slow sales, rather than letting inventory hit zero unexpectedly.\n\nInterviewer: Let's talk about Costs. Our \"Landed Cost\" per unit is high. How do you audit it?\n\nCandidate: I'd build a \"Cost Waterfall\" model in Excel.\n1. EXW (Ex Works) Price: What we pay the factory.\n2. Freight: Ocean vs Air mix.\n3. Duties/Tariffs: Are we using the right HS Code? Sometimes changing a minor component changes the HS code and drops the tariff from 25% to 0%.\n4. 3PL Fees: Pick and Pack, Storage.\nUsually, the leakage is in the 3PL. They charge for \"Long Term Storage\". If we are over-ordering, we are paying rent on dead stock. I'd calculate our \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\". If it's under 4x, we are holding too much cash in the warehouse.\n\nInterviewer: Impressive detail. We are moving from Excel to NetSuite. You've done this before. What's the biggest risk?\n\nCandidate: \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\". The migration fails if the Master Data (SKUs, BOMs) isn't clean. In my last migration, we spent 2 months just cleaning the CSV files before we even touched NetSuite. Also, user adoption. The warehouse team hates new software. You have to be on the floor with scanners showing them how it makes their job easier, or they will just bypass the system and keep using paper."
