  "transcript": "INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (Duration: 45 mins)\n\nInterviewer: Hi Chloe. Let's start with a specific scenario. Our Facebook CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) has jumped from $40 to $65 over the last month. We haven't changed the budget. What's your diagnostic checklist?\n\nCandidate: I'd look at the \"Metrics Funnel\" from top to bottom. \nFirst, CPM (Cost Per Mille). Is it a market-wide issue? If CPM is up, it might be seasonality (like Q4) or we hit a broad audience saturation.\nSecond, CTR (Click Through Rate). If CPM is stable but CTR dropped, it's \"Creative Fatigue\". People are bored of our ads.\nThird, Conversion Rate. If traffic is cheap but nobody is buying, did we break the landing page? Or did we run out of best-selling stock?\nFinally, I'd check the Attribution Window. Did Facebook change how it counts conversions again (e.g., 1-day click vs 7-day click)?\n\nInterviewer: That's a solid framework. It turns out our CTR dropped from 1.5% to 0.8%. It is creative fatigue. How do you fix it fast?\n\nCandidate: I wouldn't just \"make new ads\". That takes too long. I'd do \"Iterative Variations\". I'd take our winning video, cut the first 3 seconds, and swap in 5 different \"Hooks\" (Visual or Text). Hook 1: \"Problem/Solution\". Hook 2: \"User Testimonial\". Hook 3: \"Shock Value\". I'd launch these as a dynamic creative test. Usually, just fixing the hook restores the CTR because 80% of people scroll past in the first 3 seconds.\n\nInterviewer: Great answer. Let's talk about LTV (Lifetime Value). We sell a $50 product. Our CPA is $40. Are we profitable?\n\nCandidate: On the first order, your margin is likely thin. If COGS (Cost of Goods) is $10 and shipping is $5, you are losing money on the first sale ($50 - $10 - $5 - $40 = -$5). \nHowever, you aren't unprofitable if the LTV is high. I'd look at the \"60-Day LTV\". If 30% of customers buy a second time within 60 days, your LTV might be $80. Then a $40 CPA is fantastic. If your LTV is flat (nobody returns), then $40 is fatal. I'd build an LTV/CAC cohort analysis in Triple Whale to confirm.\n\nInterviewer: You mentioned Triple Whale. Why do you prefer it over GA4?\n\nCandidate: GA4 is cookie-based and struggles with iOS14 privacy blocks. It under-reports Facebook conversions by 20-30%. Triple Whale uses server-side pixel tracking (CAPI), so it \"sees\" the purchases that Apple hides. It gives me the \"Real ROAS\" so I can scale confidently.\n\nInterviewer: Okay, last question. We need to launch on TikTok. The CEO thinks we can just repost our Instagram Reels there. What do you think?\n\nCandidate: That will fail. TikTok is a \"Sound-On\" and \"Lo-Fi\" platform. Instagram Reels are polished and aesthetic. If you put a polished ad on TikTok, users swipe instantly because it smells like an ad. We need to shoot native, UGC-style content (User Generated Content) specifically for TikTok. It needs to look like a random person filmed it on their phone, not a studio shoot."
